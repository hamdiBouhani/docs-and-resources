[1]   Check Overview page, istio-system and default namespaces have a warning on Istio Config

[2]   Navigate to bookinfo-gateway Istio Config on default namespace

[3]   Update the wildcard in the gateway to resolve the ambiguity

* -> bookinfo.istio-cluster.org

[4]   VirtualService is linked with a Gateway but it's a good practice to resolve the ambiguity on this case too

* -> bookinfo.istio-cluster.org

[5]   Save Gateway and VirtualHost on default and check the overview page
